# Rubric for grading in-class exercises
## Econ 184, Econometrics, Professor James Ji   

In-class exercises are graded on a semi-effort basis, as the purpose of the exercise is to encourgage in class participation. Specifically:

* Students will receive full mark if they:
    - Get the correct answer of the problem, or
    - Get the answer wrong, but clearly demonstrate that they understand how to do the problem.
* Students will receive 75% of the mark if they:
    - Get the answer wrong, and the intermediate steps are thoughtful, albeit flawed.
* Students will receive 50% of the mark if they:
    - Get the answer and/or the intermediate steps completely wrong

There are NO formatting requirement for the in-class exercises.
