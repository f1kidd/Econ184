1. Calculate $Pr(Y > -1)$, where Y~N(-3,4)

```{r}
pnorm(-1,-3,sqrt(4),lower.tail=F)
```

2. Generate and plot 100 random numbers from the standard normal distribution

```{r}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

3. The SAT score is approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 1051 points and a standard deviation of 211 points. If you sit at the 97th percentile of the score distribution, what is your score?

```{r}
# pnorm returns the cdf of a normal distribution
qnorm(0.97,1051,211)
```
