\subsection{Teaching Modes}\label{teaching-modes}}

This class will be taught fully in person unless otherwise notified.
Automatic recordings of synchronous class sessions will be uploaded to
LATTE shortly after each lecture. Attendance will not be tracked, and
you are not required to inform the instructor when you will miss an
in-person class session.

\subsection[COVID-19 and Our Classroom]{\texorpdfstring{COVID-19 and Our
Classroom\footnote{Courtesy of Dr.~Guy McHendry, Creighton University.}}{COVID-19 and Our Classroom}}\label{covid-19-and-our-classroom1}}

We are still very much in a public health crisis. It is important to
begin from the premise because the pandemic fundamentally shapes what
this semester looks like, how we inhabit the class, and how we treat
each other.

Here are some thoughts that I want to share with you upfront:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We are all in this pandemic together - your actions will affect not
  only yourself: but also your loved ones, my loved ones, and every one
  of our community members.
\item
  Some of our lives may be relatively unaffected by the pandemic, while
  others have experienced profound tragedies. Do not make assumptions
  about others' experiences with the virus.
\item
  We need to show compassion and respect to each other. Now more than
  ever.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{on-symptoms}{%
\subsubsection{On Symptoms}\label{on-symptoms}}

If you are sick, particularly if you bear any symptoms resembling
COVID-19 or if you test positive for COVID, do not come to class until
you are cleared. Lecture recordings will be provided, and I will work
with you to make sure you can catch up.

\hypertarget{on-vaccines}{%
\subsubsection{On Vaccines}\label{on-vaccines}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine.
\item
  I will NOT ask whether you have been vaccinated, and you do not have
  any obligation to tell me your vaccination status.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{on-masks2}{%
\subsubsection[On Masks]{\texorpdfstring{On
Masks\footnote{Mask policies are subject to change following
  state/university masking guidelines and/or public health risk
  assessments based on the precautionary principle.}}{On Masks}}\label{on-masks2}}

Per university policy (as of 8/18/2021), masks are required for
synchronous class sessions and for office hours with more than 4 persons
present. Masks need to cover both your mouth and your nose. Exceptions
are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When you take a brief sip of beverage.
\item
  When speaking in a group setting where all others present are masked.
  The speaker(s) may lower or remove their mask while speaking and then
  raise or replace their mask to allow others to speak.
\item
  Other exceptions/accommodations approved by the instructor.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

Is your Brandeis education worth it?\footnote{There has been extensive
  research on the return to education on earnings and non-wage outcomes.
  See, e.g., Card (1999 Handbook of Labor Economics) and Oreopoulos and
  Salvanes (2011 JEP).} How much impact does climate change have on
agriculture\footnote{Deschenes and Greenstone (2007 AER): the Economics
  Impacts of Climate Change.}, the economy\footnote{Dell, Jones and
  Olken (2012 AEJ): Temperature Shocks and Economic Growth.}, or your
PSAT score?\footnote{Goodman et al.~(2019 AEJ) Heat and Learning.} What
explains the sex ratio imbalance in East Asia\footnote{Ebenstein (2010
  JHR): the ``Missing Girls'' of China and the Unintended Consequences
  of the One Child Policy.} and Southeastern Asia\footnote{Jayachandran
  and Pande (2017 AER): Why Are Indian Children So Short? Anukruti,
  Bhalotra and Tam (2021 EJ): On the Quantity and Quality of Girls.}?
Fascinating questions as they are, we are not here to seek answers to
these questions directly (\emph{you are welcomed to check out relevant
courses to these questions}). Instead, you will be learning the methods
and techniques that allow you to answer these questions or any other
empirical questions that fascinate you.

Econometrics is the backbone of economics as a social science
discipline: it offers the scientific rigor just like experiments to
physics, chemistry, and medical sciences. Albeit, the ``experiments''
are set out in the real world, and econometrics provides a toolbox to
learn from those experiments. Equally importantly, econometrics provides
a framework to think about empirical problems in a rigorous way - this
credibility revolution has certainly spilled over to other fields:
e.g.~political science, public health, psychology, business, and
marketing.

In this class, you will be primed with the theoretical and the applied
aspects of econometrics. You will learn the intuitions and statistical
constructs behind various econometric tools; you will gain hands-on
experience conducting econometric analysis using modern technology; and
you will be able to read, interpret, and formulate empirical studies
using econometric tools.

\hypertarget{class-policies}{%
\subsection{Class Policies}\label{class-policies}}

\hypertarget{recitation}{%
\paragraph{Recitation}\label{recitation}}

Recitation is strongly encouraged but not mandatory. No graded parts
will be assigned during recitation time. That said, recitation is an
important component of the class where we commit dedicated times for you
to strengthen your grasp on R coding, problem sets, and prepare for
exams.

\hypertarget{computer-and-equipments}{%
\paragraph{Computer and Equipments}\label{computer-and-equipments}}

You are expected to bring a personal computer to most lecture sessions,
as we will be completing in-class exercises. You are expected NOT to use
your computer to do anything unrelated to the class. Doing so not only
hinders your own learning but also potentially distracts your
colleagues. I reserve the right to place you in the last row of the
classroom or ask you to leave the classroom.

You will need to have the following software installed on your computer.
These softwares are available across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) and
free of charge.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R (separate from RStudio)
\item
  Rstudio
\end{itemize}

If you encounter any difficulties with pieces of equipment that hinder
your learning, please reach out to me immediately, and I will do my best
to help. Additionally, Brandeis offers student emergency funds to
students in need. Email
\href{mailto:emergencyfunds@brandeis.edu}{\nolinkurl{emergencyfunds@brandeis.edu}}
for more information.

\hypertarget{credit-hours}{%
\paragraph{Credit Hours}\label{credit-hours}}

Success in this four-credit course is based on the expectation that
students will spend a minimum of nine hours of study time per week in
preparation for class (readings, papers, discussion sections,
preparation for exams, etc.

\hypertarget{academic-honesty}{%
\paragraph{Academic Honesty}\label{academic-honesty}}

Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the
highest standards of academic integrity. A student shall not submit work
that is falsified or is not the result of the student's own effort.
Infringement of academic honesty by a student subjects that student to
serious penalties, which may include failure on the assignment, failure
in the course, suspension from the University or other sanctions (see
section 20 of Brandeis University Rights and Responsibilities). Please
consult Brandeis University Rights and Responsibilities (see
\url{https://www.brandeis.edu/studentlife/srcs/rightsresponsibilities/index.html})
for all policies and procedures related to academic integrity. Students
may be required to submit work to TurnItIn.com software to verify
originality. A student who is in a course or assignment should consult
the faculty member responsible for that course or assignment before
submitting the work. Allegations of alleged academic dishonesty will be
forwarded to the Department of Student Rights and Community Standards.

\hypertarget{accommodations}{%
\paragraph{Accommodations}\label{accommodations}}

Brandeis seeks to welcome and include all students. If you are a student
who needs accommodations as outlined in an accommodations letter, please
reach out me and present your letter of accommodation as soon as you
can. I want to support you.

In order to provide test accommodations, I need the letter more than 48
hours in advance. I want to provide your accommodations but cannot do so
retroactively. If you have questions about documenting a disability or
requesting accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Support
