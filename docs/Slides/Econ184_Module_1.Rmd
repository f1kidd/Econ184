## Econ 184b, Econometrics, Fall 2021	
### Module 1: Statistics Review

## Population and data: repeated sampling
Example 1: an abstract population

* Population: a Bernoulli distribution with mean $p$ = 0.5
* Data: a random sample of 54 observations from the above population/distribution
* How to think about the population and data? 

## 
* The above population is the distribution of a fair coin. A fair coin gives a random outcome of 1 (head) or 0 (tail) with equal probability.
* However, this does NOT mean that if you flip a fair coin 54 times, you will always get 27 heads and 27 tails! When you flip the coin 54 times, what you get is data: 54 binary numbers. 

Try this in R: 
```{r,results=F}
a = rbinom(54, 1, 0.5)
print(a)
mean(a)
# The rbinom function generates random numbers with the binomial distribution.
```


## 
* In other words: data is a random realization from the population.
  - Goal of econometrics: learn the population from random data.
* From the data, we determine whether the data is from a fair coin.

Try this in R: 
```{r,results=F}
a = rbinom(54, 1, 0.5)
b = rbinom(54, 1, 0.4)
mean(a)
mean(b)
```

## Example 2: a concrete population
Population: country of origin of all students at Brandeis (5771 students)

* The population is 5771 numbers (either 1 "domestic" or 0 "international") and 4161 of these numbers are 1.
* The population is represented by a Bernoulli distribution 
  - mean $p$ = $\frac{4161}/{5771} = 0.7210189
* Data: a random sample of 54 observations from the above population.

##
How to think about the population and data:

* Again, data is a random realization from the population.
* Goal of econometrics: learn the population from random data.
* Of course, if we are an administrator who observes the entire population, then there‚Äôs no need to do econometrics.

**Econometrics/statistics is only useful when we do not observe the population.**

## In many cases, we **never** observe the entire population

Example: population unemployment rate in the U.S.

* Goal: find out exactly what percentage of the people are unemployed.
* Population: employment status of everyone in the U.S. (over 300 million)
* Can we observe the population?
  - If we could send a drone to spy on every person in the U.S. and find out their employment status, then yes. But in practice, this cannot possibly be done.

##
* Data: interview 500 people and find out their employment status.
* How to think about the population and the data:
  - Population: 300 million numbers (either 1 ‚Äúunemployed‚Äù or 0
‚Äúemployed‚Äù).
  - This is represented by a Bernoulli distribution with mean p, where p is the percentage of 1 in these 300 million numbers.
  - Data: 500 random realization from the above Bernoulli distribution
  

## Probability distributions
* Notations
  - We will use R.V for the phrase ‚ÄúRandom variable‚Äù.
  - Upper case letters (e.g., X and Y) denote R.V‚Äôs.
  - Lower case letters (e.g., a and b) denote non-random numbers
(constants).
* Discrete R.V: a random variable that takes only a discrete set of values, like
0, 1, 2....
  - Example: Bernoulli R.V. (only takes value 0 and 1).
* Continuous R.V: a random variable that can take any value in a continuum.
  - Example: normal R.V. (can take any value in $\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers)
  
##
* The randomness of a R.V., $X$, can be fully summarized by the cumulative
distribution function (cdf) of $X$:
  - $F(x)$ is a function of $x$ (non-random): $F(x)=Pr(X\leq x)$.
  - Notation: $Pr$ denotes the probability of an event.
  - $F(x)$ is non-decreasing: $F(1) \leq F(2)$.
* If the event $X\leq 1$ occurs, then $X\leq 2$ must occur. Therefore,
$Pr(X\leq 1)$ ‚â§ $Pr(X\leq 2)$.
* If the cdf is differentiable, then the derivative is called the probability density
function (pdf): $f(x) = dF(x)/dx$.
  - Discrete R.V. cannot have a differentiable cdf so discrete R.V. do not
have a pdf.

## 
Example: if X is a continuous R.V., how to compute $Pr(15<X\leq 20)$?

* From the cdf:
* From the pdf:

## Expected value or expectation or mean

Example:
‚Ä¢ Pr(ùëã = 1) = ùëù and Pr(ùëã = 0) = 1 ‚àí ùëù.
‚Ä¢ Then ùê∏(ùëã) = 1 √ó ùëù + 0 √ó (1 ‚àí ùëù) = ùëù. So for Bernoulli variables, the
probability of ùëã = 1 is the same as the mean ùê∏(ùëã).
Example:
‚Ä¢ Possible values of ùëã are 3, 73 and 89 with the following distribution:
Pr(ùëã = 3) = 0.2 and Pr(ùëã = 73) = 0.35 and Pr(ùëã = 89) = 0.45
‚Ä¢ Then ùê∏(ùëã) = 3 √ó 0.2 + 73 √ó 0.35 + 89 √ó 0.45 = 66.2
