You are given the following distribution: Possible values of X are 7, 77 and 777 with the following probability:

Pr(X=7)=0.7    
Pr(X=77)=0.2    
Pr(X=777)=0.1  

1. Generate a random sample of N=1000 from above that distribution. Plot your sample. What is the mean of your sample?
2. What is the variance of the distribution?
3. What is the variance of your sample?
